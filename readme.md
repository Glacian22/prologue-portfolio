# Behold the Portfolio, in all of it's Majesty
For this version of my portfolio, I decided to use a design by aj@lkn.io, as it has some nice aesthetic features I wanted to play around with. After coding my previous few designs myself, I thought it would be nice to work with some else's and see how they approach things. IE it's pretty than what I was working on :P
